Calculator Project 1 - Simple Arithmetic Calculator
This is a basic calculator I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I built it to practice using JavaScript for handling user input and updating results dynamically. The design is simple and responsive, making it easy to use for quickÂ calculations.
